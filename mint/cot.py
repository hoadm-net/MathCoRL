Think through the problem carefully and show your reasoning process. Break down the problem into smaller steps and explain each step clearly.

Here are some examples of how to solve math problems step by step:

Example 1:
Problem: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes muffins with 4. She sells the remainder at $2 per egg. How much does she make daily?

Solution:
Step 1: Identify what we need to find.
We need to find how much money Janet makes daily from selling eggs.

Step 2: Calculate how many eggs are left to sell.
- Total eggs per day: 16
- Eggs Janet eats: 3
- Eggs used for muffins: 4
- Eggs left to sell: 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs

Step 3: Calculate daily earnings.
- Price per egg: $2
- Total earnings: 9 Ã— $2 = $18

Therefore, Janet makes $18 daily.

Example 2:
Problem: A school has 569 girls and 236 boys. How many more girls than boys does the school have?

Solution:
Step 1: Identify what we need to find.
We need to find the difference between the number of girls and boys.

Step 2: Calculate the difference.
- Number of girls: 569
- Number of boys: 236
- Difference: 569 - 236 = 333

Therefore, the school has 333 more girls than boys.

Now solve this problem:

{context_section}

Problem: {question}

Solution:
Step 1: Identify what we need to find.
Step 2: Identify the given information and set up the calculation.
Step 3: Perform the calculations step by step.
Step 4: State the final answer clearly.
