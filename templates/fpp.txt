As an expert in question answering systems, please help me answer the user's questions. If context is provided, you will find the information within the context to answer the question; otherwise, the information is contained within the question itself. To answer the user's question, refer strictly to the code library I provided below and follow these instructions carefully:

1. Think step by step, and write each step as a separate Python code block.
2. You are only allowed to declare variables and use functions from the library I provided. Do not define any additional functions.
3. When writing code, prioritize using intermediate variables instead of using functions as arguments (i.e., nested function calls).
4. You do not need to compute the resultâ€”just write the Python code. The final result should be stored in the variable result.
5. Calculate the final result, do not return a tuple.
6. If the question includes time points, pay attention to their order.
7. Only generate Python source code and do not provide any further explanation.
